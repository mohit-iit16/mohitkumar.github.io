### # Employment History

#### Freelance Developer - Tinybyte.ai (May 2025 - Present)
- TBA

#### Senior Research Engineer - American Express (Apr 2022 - Apr 2025)
- __Vocal - Voice of Customers__: Spearheaded the implementation of a new ETL pipeline, streamlining the data
collection process for customer complaints and enhancing overall data integrity for advanced analysis. Developed a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline utilizing advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
significantly improving the accuracy of analysis and reducing human efforts by more than 80%.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to extract insights from specific datasets, delivering actionable
recommendations with rapid turnaround times to support decision-making.
- __Model Interpretability for Large Language Models (LLMs)__: Developed and implemented model
interpretability guidelines to ensure transparency and trustworthiness of GPT-based Large Language
Models (LLMs) for enterprise-wide applications. Designed and introduced a novel evaluation mechanism to
assess the performance, reliability, and scalability of LLMs, enabling robust deployment of LLM-based solutions
across the organization.
- __TTYD - Talk to Your Data__: Responsible for developing a question answering system that could process
natural language queries and deliver fast, accurate (upto 87%) responses to users. Deployed it into production,
monitored how it was performing, identified ways to improve response times and latency, and implemented
optimizations to achieve a better overall user experience.

#### Senior Data Scientist - EXL Service (Jun 2019 - Aug 2021)  
- __Key-Concept Extraction__: Developed and published Key-Concept Extraction Engine, an unsupervised model to
automatically extract topics from call transcripts, served with a user-friendly web-app with backend based on
Django and PostgreSQL. Employed Dynamic topic modeling (DTM) techniques to analyze the evolution of topics
of conversation over time. Achieved 85% satisfaction score on manual validation of transcripts.

#### Machine Learning Engineer - Tvarit GmbH (Aug 2018 - Dec 2018)  
- __Automated Predictive Analytics Tool (APA)__: Involved in development of APA tool, a Time Series
Predictive Analytics tool which automatically does anomaly detection, feature selection, model tuning, and
deployment as well as performance monitoring and logging.
