## # [GENWISE: Thematic Discovery from Textual Data](https://aclanthology.org/2024.finnlp-2.8.pdf)

"In this work, we introduce GENWISE - a generative AI-based framework designed to stream-
line extracting and organizing key information from textual data. Focusing on the preva-
lent issue in business where significant time is spent on manual data analysis, our framework
employs cutting-edge generative AI, embedding, and clustering techniques towards a thematic discovery. We further deliver hierarchical
thematic representations, enhancing the ease
of understanding for users at different levels.
Our methodology includes precise issue extraction through generative AI, utilization of the
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework
for improved accuracy, and a 20% improvement in cluster coherency using the Enhanced
Community Detection algorithm. This comprehensive pipeline is optimized explicitly for
industrial settings, offering a significant leap
in efficiency and thematic representation for
complex data sets..."

## # [Comparative Analysis of Transformers for Modeling Tabular Data: A Casestudy using Industry Scale Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14335)
"We perform a comparative analysis of transformer-based models
designed for modeling tabular data, specifically on an industry-scale
dataset. While earlier studies demonstrated promising outcomes on
smaller public or synthetic datasets, the effectiveness did not extend
to larger industry-scale datasets. The challenges identified include
handling high-dimensional data, the necessity for efficient pre-
processing of categorical and numerical features, and addressing
substantial computational requirements.
To overcome the identified challenge..."
